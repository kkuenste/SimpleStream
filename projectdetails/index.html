  <h1>Project Description</h1>

  <h4>Summary</h4>
  <p> Using Reddit's API we are creating a site for users to have a more personalized experience. They can input preferences, such as their mood or specific topics, and receive relevant posts and subreddits. The goal of Simple Stream is to give the user a much more efficient experience with Reddit and show only what they want to see.</p>

  <h4>Application Domain </h4>
  <p>MySQL database</p>

  <h4>Usefulness </h4>
  <p> This would be useful for any current Reddit user, where they can get the posts they want to see faster without having to look through as many posts. This site is also good for people who have never used Reddit before, where they can have a more streamlined experience.</p>
  <h4>Realness</h4>
  <p>We are getting all of our data from Reddit's API, which includes subreddits, posts, comments, etc.</p>

  <h4>Functionality</h4>
  <p>Basic Functions: Insert, update, and delete new: subreddits, posts, comments. Another basic function will be searching the database and displaying the results.</p>
  <p>Advanced Functions: </p>
  <p>(1) Recommended posts based on what user's preferences are.</p>
  <p>(2) The user can subscribe to an email each morning that includes 3 of their top recommended posts.</p>
